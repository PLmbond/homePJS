**[Profound.js](http://www.profoundjs.com)** greatly simplifies the development of database-driven applications for Web and Mobile. It helps in both creating new applications and modernizing legacy code.

For a high-level overview, see [The Secret to Building Great Node.js Apps Unveiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3AqCtmewY&list=PLMKReiMT1gUPuvg2zOst-lwCLE_Fbl-yD&index=21), or visit [http://www.profoundjs.com](http://www.profoundjs.com).

Profound.js consists of 3 main components:

[Profound.js Framework](https://www.profoundlogic.com/docs/display/PUI/Profound.js+Framework) – Free npm package that gives JavaScript robust business programming capabilities, such as strong data types and the ability to code business applications in a transactional top-down manner. It also includes the [Profound UI Visual Designer](https://www.profoundlogic.com/docs/display/PUI/Visual+Designer+for+Profound.js) tool for building browser and mobile interfaces visually.

[Profound.js Connector](https://www.profoundlogic.com/docs/display/PUI/Profound.js+Connector) – Commercial offering that provides streamlined connectivity options to popular relational databases (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM Db2) and IBM i resources like DB2 data, programs, commands, service programs, and operating system API.

[Profound.js Converter](https://www.profoundlogic.com/docs/display/PUI/Profound.js+Converter) – Tool to automatically convert legacy RPGLE code into clean Node.js code.


## Installation

To install Profound.js, create a new directory and issue the command "npm install profoundjs" as follows:

```
mkdir profoundjs
cd profoundjs
npm install profoundjs
```

Follow the npm install prompts to complete the installation.

When installing Profound.js on IBM i, you will also be prompted to install Profound.js Connector IBM i ILE components. These components are required for many of the features provided by Profound.js. Profound.js Connector requires a valid license key. You can request a trial license key by contacting [Profound Logic](https://www.profoundlogic.com).

## Usage

The Profound.js installation process will create a start.js file in your directory. It will look something like this:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

// Load Profound.js
var profoundjs = require("profoundjs");

// Process command line arguments
profoundjs.rlog = process.argv.includes("-rlog");
profoundjs.tlog = process.argv.includes("-tlog");

// Apply configuration
var config = require("./config.js");
profoundjs.applyConfig(config);

// Start Profound.js server
var isWorker = profoundjs.server.listen();
if (isWorker) {

  // This is the top-level Express Application.
  // Custom Express coding can be added here.
  var express = profoundjs.server.express;
  var app = profoundjs.server.app;
  app.use(express.json());  // default to use JSON-encoded post data
 
}
```

Using Node, the server can be started as follows:

`node start.js`

Or, it can be started using the STRTCPSVR command on IBM i.
